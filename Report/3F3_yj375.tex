Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of the kernel density method compared with the histogram method for estimation of a probability density from random samples:

Theoretical  mean and standard deviation calculation for uniform density as a function of $N$:

Plot of histograms for $N=100$,  $N=1000$ and $N=10000$ with theoretical mean  and $\pm 3$ standard deviation lines:

 Are your histogram results consistent with the multinomial distribution theory?

\item {\bf Functions of random variables}
For normally distributed ${\cal N}(x|0,1)$ random variables, take $y=f(x)=ax+b$. Calculate $p(y)$ using the Jacobian formula:


{\em Text/maths answer  here}
\vspace{3in}


Explain how this is linked to the general normal density with non-zero mean and non-unity variance:


{\em Text/maths answer  here}
\vspace{3in}



 Verify this formula by transforming a large collection of random samples $x^{(i)}$ to give $y^{(i)}=f(x^{(i)})$, histogramming the resulting $y$ samples, and overlaying a plot of your formula calculated using the Jacobian:


{\em Include your graphic here}
\vspace{3in}




Now take $p(x)={\cal N}(x|0,1)$ and $f(x)=x^2$. Calculate $p(y)$ using the Jacobian formula:

 Verify your result by histogramming of transformed random samples:

\item{\bf Inverse CDF method} 



Calculate the CDF and the inverse CDF for the exponential distribution: 

The pdf of an exponential distribution Y with mean 1 is:
\begin{equation*}
    f_Y(y) = e^{-y} 
\end{equation*}
The corresponding cdf is found by integration:
\begin{equation*}
    F_Y(y) = \int_{0}^{y} f_Y(t)dt = \int_0^y e^{-t}dt = 1 - e^{-y}
\end{equation*}
The inverse of this function is found by: $x = F_Y(y), y = F^{-1}_Y(x)$.
\begin{equation*}
    F^{-1}_Y(x) = -\ln{(1-x)} 
\end{equation*}

Matlab/Python code for inverse CDF method for generating samples from the exponential distribution:


\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, caption={MATLAB}]
x_data = np.random.uniform(0,1,1000)
y_data = -np.log(1-x_data)

y = np.linspace(0,5,1000)
exp_theoretical = np.e**(-y)
\end{lstlisting}



Plot histograms/ kernel density estimates and overlay them on the desired exponential density:

\item {\bf Simulation from a `non-standard'  density.}

Matlab/Python code to generate $N$ random numbers drawn from the distribution of $X$:
\vspace{3in}

Plot some histogram density estimates with $\alpha=0.5,\,1.5$ and several values of $\beta$. 

\vspace{3in}

Hence comment on the interpretation of the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
