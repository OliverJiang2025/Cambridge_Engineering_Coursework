\subsection{(§2.2 Modelling Manual Control) Nyquist diagram (from Bode diagram) for
controller in series with plant.}
From Figure \ref{fig:fig2}, in which the upper graph is the magnitude plot while the lower graph is the phase plot. Information contained in this two plot are combined to give the shape of Nyquist Diagram of $K(j\omega)G(j\omega)$, which is given in Figure \ref{fig:nyq}.

\end{figure}
It is clear that the Nyquist Diagram behaves in a spiral shape approaching the origin point of the Argand Diagram. It is due to $e^{-j\omega D}$ term which rises an exponential decay of magnitude while keeping the curve "rotating" as 
$\omega \to \infty$.
Besides, it is worth noting that the Nyquist diagram does not encircle $(-1,j0)$ according to the magnitude plot in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}. By Nyquist Stability Criteria, this closed loop system is stable.


\subsubsection{(§2.2 Modelling Manual Control) Are you using any integral action? Give a brief
explanation. What does this imply about the accuracy of the model of the human
controller?}
Integral action was used.
As shown by Figure \ref{fig:fig3}, it is clear that an integral action was used. Starting from around 4.7s, the orange $u(t)$ curve, which represents the manual control signal, maintains at around 5 to attempting to stabilize $e(t)$ to 0. This is an integral control because both the $e(t)$ and $\frac{de(t)}{dt}$ are zero afterwards. $u(t) = k_i \int e(t)dt$ for some $k_i$ here.
