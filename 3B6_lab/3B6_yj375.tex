\section{Introduction}
This lab activity investigates laser characteristics, 
including light-current characteristics and output spectrum. 
The goal is to understand the behavior of lasers under different 
conditions and analyze their performance based on the measured data.

\section{Part I: Measurement of Light-Current Characteristics}

The apparatus used for this measurement includes a laser diode, 
a driver circuit, a photodiode for measuring output power, 
and a transimpedance amplifier to quantify output power by voltage output.
The raw data collected from the experiment 
will be analyzed to determine some key parameters of the laser, and 
the circuits used in the experiment. The raw data will be available in appendix.

\subsection{Laser Theory}
According to laser theory, photon emission becomes stimulated
when the gain exceeds the losses in the laser cavity. This could 
be observed in the light-current (L-I) characteristics of a laser, where
the output power increases significantly once the threshold current is reached.
The expectation of the L-I curve is that it will show a linear increase in output power
after the threshold current, with a steep slope indicating efficient lasing action.

As given in the lab handout, this threshold current is between 40 and 55 mA, 
while the actual threshold current observed from the raw data is around 75 mA. 
This could be reasonable, because the operation of laser diode
is very temperature sensitive. The threshold current can increase significantly 
with temperature.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:plot}, the plot of the raw data
of L-I curve shows a clear 
threshold behavior. 
Below the threshold current, the light output is negligible. This is because the 
gain is not sufficient to overcome the losses in the cavity. 
the laser is not lasing, and only spontaneous emission occurs.
Above the threshold current, the output power increases rapidly, indicating that
the laser is lasing and the gain exceeds the losses. 
The large slope of the L-I curve above the threshold can provide 
insights into the efficiency of the laser, 
with a steeper slope indicating higher efficiency in 
converting electrons to photons.

    \caption{Plot and linear fit of raw data}
    \label{fig:plot}
\end{figure}

While the other plot shows relation of voltage across the laser diode and
the current through the laser diode. The V-I relation can be derived 
from the equivalent circuit of the laser diode, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:eqcct}.


\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Equivalent_circuit.png}
    \caption{Equivalent Circuit of Laser Diode}
    \label{fig:eqcct}
\end{figure}

There is a non-negligible stray series resistance in the laser diode,
which contributes to the increase in voltage across the laser diode as the current increases.

The relation could be expressed as:
\begin{equation*}
    V = V_{th} + I \cdot R_s
\end{equation*}

Where V and I are the voltage across the laser diode and the current through the laser diode,
respectively. $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage, and $R_s$ is the stray series resistance.

By the linear fit of the V-I curve, 
we can determine the threshold voltage and the stray series resistance.
$V_{th} \approx 1.262 V$, and $R_s \approx 21.505 \Omega$.

From the circuit diagram given, the stray series resistance is 26 $\Omega$,
which is close to the value obtained from the linear fit, with an error of 
$17.3\%$. This error could be attributed to the measurement errors, 
and the non-ideal behavior of the laser diode.

With the threshold value of perfect diode, we could estimate the lasing
wavelength of the laser diode $\lambda_0$ by the following equation:

\begin{equation*}
    \lambda_0 = \frac{hc}{eV_{th}}
\end{equation*}

The value of wavelength is 983.12nm, which is within infrared range.
This calculation agrees to the observation during the lab. There was
no visible light emitted from the laser diode. 



\subsection{Error Analysis}






\section{Part II: Measurement of laser output spectrum}
In thie part, the output spectrum of the laser diode 
is measured using an optical spectrum analyzer. Data is collected
for both stimulated and under-stimulated conditions, 
and the results are analyzed to understand the spectral 
characteristics of the laser output.

\subsection{Effective Refraction Index of the Semiconductor Material}
Within the cavity of the laser, the light forms a standing wave,
with a wavelength $\lambda_g = \frac{\lambda}{n}$. 
Where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light in vacuum, 
and $n$ is the effective refraction index of the semiconductor material.
This wavelength should satisfy the resonance condition of the cavity, which is given by:
\begin{equation*}
    m  \frac{\lambda_g}{2} = L
\end{equation*}
Where m is an integer representing the mode number, and L is the length of the cavity. 
By rearranging the equation, we can express the wavelength in vacuum as:
\begin{equation*}
    \lambda = \frac{2nL}{m} \to f = \frac{mc}{2nL}
\end{equation*}

The change in frequency is:
\begin{equation*}
    \delta f = \frac{c}{2nL}
\end{equation*}

From $f = \frac{c}{\lambda}$, $\delta f = \frac{c}{\lambda^2} \delta \lambda$, 
we can derive the change in wavelength as:
\begin{equation*}
    \delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{2nL}
\end{equation*}

Thus, the effective refraction index can be calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
    n = \frac{\lambda^2}{2L \Delta \lambda}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Measurement of Laser Output Spectrum}
The observed output spectrum of the laser diode
shows multiple peaks, which correspond to different longitudinal modes of the laser cavity.
Figure \ref{fig:four_images} and Figure \ref{fig:unfour_images} in the appendix
show the output spectrum under stimulated and under-stimulated conditions, 
respectively. The collected data is shown in Figure \ref{fig:specdata}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{spec_data.png}
    \caption{Spectrum Data}
    \label{fig:specdata}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Discussion and Analysis}
By comparing the two sets of data, it is clear that 
the only discrepancy is the 3dB width of the spectrum. 
The 3dB width of the spectrum under stimulated condition is narrower 
than that under under-stimulated condition. This is 
expected because the stimulated photon emission 
leads to a more concentrated spectrum,
while spontaneous emission results in a broader spectrum 
due to the random nature of photon emission.

The center wavelengths of the two spectra are very close, 
which indicates that the lasing wavelength range is consistent 
regardless of the stimulation condition.

At last, the ripple width corresponds to $\Delta \lambda$ 
in the equation for effective refraction index. As the two 
measurements use the same laser diode, the ripple widths are 
expected to be the same.

The effective refraction index could be calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
    n = \frac{\lambda_{center}^2}{2L \Delta \lambda} = 
\end{equation*}
